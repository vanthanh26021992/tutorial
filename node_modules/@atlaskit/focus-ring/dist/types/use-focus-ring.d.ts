 * __Use focus ring__
 *
 * This component has accessibility issues that we are working to resolve.
 * Do not use without support from the Atlassian Design System accessibility team.
 *
 * The useFocusRing hook manages focus in the rare cases where the focus ring’s visual application and the element that takes focus differ.
 * This is not typically a good practice for accessibility, so don’t do this unless you’ve consulted with the accessibility team.
