# Icon

An icon is a visual representation of a command, device, directory, or common action.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @atlaskit/icon
```

## Usage

Icons should be used intentionally to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load. Use it to call attention to a particular action, command, or section. If you’re questioning an icon’s use, it probably doesn’t need to be used.
