### Major Changes

- [`9d0f54a809`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/9d0f54a809)

  **Summary**

  The goal of this major for TextField is to improve the component's performance, by both reducing static structure and avoiding unnecessary function calls.

  **Changes**

  In this version we improved the performance of `TextField` by making it more similar to a native input field and removing the slow theme prop.

  **Theming**

  The `theme` prop allows you to customize the appearance of `TextField`.
  Theming was previously used to customize the container div and input element styling in `TextField`.
  We found that there was minimal usage of this API and it was identified to have a negative performance impact regardless of whether it was used.

  We decided to remove this API to benefit all consumers of `TextField`.
  If you would like to continue customizing TextField we have added data attributes (`data-ds--text-field--container` and `data-ds--text-field--input`) to both container div and input element of `TextField`.
  Therefore consumers can use this if they want to override style of respective element in `TextField`. For example,

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react';
  import { css } from '@emotion/core';
  import { TextField } from '@atlaskit/textfield';

  export default function CustomStyleExample() {
    return (
      <TextField
        css={{
          padding: 5,
          border: '2px solid orange',
          '& > [data-ds--text-field--input]': {
            fontSize: 20,
            border: '2px solid green',
          },
        }}
      />
    );
  }
  ```

  You can also override CSS using `className` and data-attributes in `TextField`.

  ```jsx
  // component
  import React from 'react';
  import { TextField } from '@atlaskit/textfield';
  import './styles.css';

  export default () => {
    return (
        <TextField
          width="large"
          className='myClass'
        />
    );
  };

  // styles.css
  .myClass [data-ds--text-field--container] {
    border: 2px solid orange;
    padding: 5px;
  }
  .myClass [data-ds--text-field--input] {
    border: 2px solid green;
    font-size: 20px;
  };

  ```

  Note that `TextField` still supports the light mode / dark mode global token.
  Along with this change we have removed the exports `ThemeProps`, `ThemeTokens` and `Theme` from `TextField` as they can no longer be used with the removal of `theme`.

  ### Other changes

  - Previously all interaction styles were generated in JavaScript using events, causing unnecessary and slow re-renders for actions like hovering and focusing. Now all styles for the `TextField` are applied using CSS selectors.
  - Updated the entry point to only export `TextField` and `TextFieldProps`. These exports `ThemeProps`, `ThemeTokens` and `Theme` have now been removed.

  ### Automatic upgrading

  There is a codemod that assists you in upgrading most of the changes from above.
  However, a manual step is still required to override styles via data attributes.

  - Removes `theme` and `overrides` prop.
  - Removes imports of `ThemeProps`, `ThemeTokens` and `Theme`.

  ```

  # You first need to have the latest `TextField` installed before you can run the codemod
  `yarn upgrade @atlaskit/textfield@^5.0.0`

  # Run the codemod cli
  # Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain `import` and
  `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder, we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases, saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for external) if you have any questions or queries about this.

## 0.2.0

- [minor][e9b824bf86](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/e9b824bf86):

  - **Breaking**: Changes to the `theme` prop. The type of this prop remains as `(ThemeTokens, ThemeProps) => ThemeTokens`.
    - The shape of `ThemeTokens` has changed. `container` and `input` keys are now required. The value of these keys are style objects.
    - More information has been added to ThemeProps.

  ```diff
  type ThemeTokens = {
  - backgroundColor: string
  - backgroundColorFocus: string
  - backgroundColorHover: string
  - borderColor: string
  - borderColorFocus: string
  - textColor: string
  - disabledTextColor: string
  - placeholderTextColor: string
  + container: Object,
  + input: Object
  }

  type ThemeProps = {
    appearance: ThemeAppearance,
    mode: 'dark' | 'light',
  +  isDisabled: boolean,
  +  isFocused: boolean,
  +  isHovered: boolean,
  +  isInvalid: boolean,
  +  isMonospaced: boolean,
  +  isCompact: boolean,
  +  width?: string | number,
  };
  ```
